# Opening hours frontend assignment

## Installation

`npm install`

## Get started

1. `npm start`
2. open http://localhost:3000

## Architecture

### Tech stack

- React
- Typescript
- Styled components
- Vite

### Code Quality tools

- Automated code style by Prettier
- Automated linting by Eslint based on [Airbnb eslint config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)
- Static typing by Typescript

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#readme) modules hook to git and run automated checks locally on pre-commit.

[Renovate bot](https://docs.renovatebot.com/#why-use-renovate) provides automated updates for node deps for Github hosted repositories. I prefer Renovate to Dependabot, as the former can update multiple packages in a single PR thanks to its [Noise reduction feature](https://docs.renovatebot.com/noise-reduction/).

Editorconfig assures standardized file formatting across different code editors.

Github workflow `checks.yml` runs quality checks and tests the build on every push. The workflow is optimized by caching `node_modules` and canceling previous runs on opening a new PR.

### Builder

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a next generation frontend tooling developed and maintained by Vue.js community.

- well maintained and being used as a default solution in a major framework
- takes advantage of fast [Golang EcmaScript compiler](https://esbuild.github.io/) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) plugins ecosystem
- has minimal configuration

### Testing

[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is a replacement for [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for projects based on Vite. Migration from Jest to Vitest is seamless as the Vitest API is [compatible with Jest](https://vitest.dev/guide/migration.html#migrating-from-jest).

[React-testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) provides integration testing tooling for React components.

### Data fetching

Even though it may seem like an overkill for the task I decided to demonstrate my general approach for data fetching and advanced tooling for API emulation in browsers.

[MSW library](https://mswjs.io/) mocks backend and provides the same debugging experience as real API calls - [inspect Network request in devtools](https://mswjs.io/docs/#why-service-workers). It also [replaces fetch mocking](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch) in integration tests.

[React-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) is a library for managing server state, it uses the stale-while-revalidate caching strategy and replaces general purpose state management libraries like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

### Implementation Logic

Opening hours payload gets loaded from the mocked endpoint. The data processing is divided on 2 steps for easier testing:

1. Translate the payload to a list of days with opening hours according to business requirements.
2. Display the list of days according to UI mockups.

The logic of each step is described in detail in its test specs:

- `utils/transformHours/**test**/`
- `components/Hours/DisplayTime.test.tsx`

The initial payload can not be used as data source directly as itâ€™s a key-value object. By definition objects is an unordered collection of properties, hence there is a chance to display days of the week in wrong order.

### UI Features

- Loading spinner for data request
- Centered Layout utilizing flexbox
- Highlighted current day of the week
- Dark/Light theme switcher
- Global theme config
